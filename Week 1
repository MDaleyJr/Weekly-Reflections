Week 1

The first week of the Cybervets program was better than I anticipated. 
I’m a part of Cohort Bravo. Unfortunately one of members had his skillbridge yanked last minute so we are a team of 2. 
Downside less ideas or points of views to attack from….the plus as long as Nick and I don’t annoy each other we will develop a report little quicker. 
Right out the gate, day 2 we jump into the PicoCTF challenge. 
Fortunately I was able to devote some time to TryHackMe.com, about 2 weeks. It was a massive help. 
Thanks to the hours log there I had some knowledge of the linux system and the tools needed for the basic challenges. 
The days before this program started I did have a thought, a small one. Am I making the right decision, will I actually like cybersecurity? 
Yes, absolutely. Its hard, I have  a lot to learn. But I’m loving it. The research, the learning, the trial and error….I’m here for all of it.
