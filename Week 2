Week 2

Another good week of learning new things. We worked on some more PicoCTF. 
The more challenging tasks are proving difficult but I’m enjoying the challenge. 
I also started working on my E Portfolio in Github and building my Linked In profile. 
That has been my least favorite thing so far….but one of the most important. 
I plan on getting my profiles up to date by the end of this week. 
We also had some really good discussions with Keysha on Metacognition and learning about the Judge and other Saboteurs.
