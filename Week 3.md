# Week 3
The PicoCTF2024 event is over. I thouroughly enjoyed it. 
We did very well for only having 2 weeks of cybersecurity training. TryHackMe is awesome and I'm randomly knocking out more tasks when I have free time.
We met some of the Cybervets alum this week. It's great to hear how well they are all doing. Everyone reiterated the importance of networking.
I'm loving everything we are doing so far. That includes creating some Github repositories and starting are E portfoilios. The highlight of the week was Herman.
Watching him work was AWESOME. This man solved a CTF problem in 2 hours that only 50 teams were able to solve in the 2 weeks. It was incredible watching him work.
