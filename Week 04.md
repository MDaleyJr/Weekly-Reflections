# Week 4
This week we learned about recon. We did an excercise on a random buisness located in a random location and did a soft recon. It was exercise only and 100% soft recon.
we discovered some tools of the trade and worked on a total view not just a narrow scope. Don't get locked in on the cyber portion. Look at the physical address. 
Surrounding buisness...traffic, cameras, foot traffic...look at everything. It was a good week with a a fun activity. THere is so much to learn and I'm loving it....whenever I do
get stuck on something or need a quick breather theres a million other things to research and learn. One important thing I have taken from Cybervets....isn't even cyber related.
It's taking the time to do my hobby...or just some me time. It had been months since I actually just played a video game to unwind. But just an hour once or twice a week...it
really does make a difference. Just that little bit of me time to unwind and relax its an absolute neccesity, that I didnt know I needed.
