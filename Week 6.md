# Week 6

This week we developed our initial ISSO briefing. I started out thinking the ISSO was a paper pusher, it would be a boring job with a lot of responibily and no authority. Well the last part was right. But on the other hand, I discoverd I like doing research. A few times we had questions and diving into the NIST guidance and our practice GRC to find the answers was something I am good at. Researching answers when I have little or no knowledge to start with was not an issue for me. We discovered that some people need the crawl, walk then run learning method. Others were just fine being thrown in the deep end and left to figure it out. Also this week we had our firs Hawaiian shirt Friday. I have a few of those ready to go. On the last day we went over the STAR method with Keysha. Philosophical Fridays are a great way to end the week. Its always good to review things but taking the pauses and discussing how we are doing and whats new in our lives is refreshing!
