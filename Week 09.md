# Week 9

We started the week continuing our SOC Level 1 journey in TryHackMe. Then we got into a last minute CTF! It was a short 2 day CTF. I entered in solo and knocked out a good amount. I ended up 9th out 16 teams. It was a fun one but it did reveal I need to work on my web exploitation. I'm really enjoying the CTFs....so any week with a CTF is a good week!
